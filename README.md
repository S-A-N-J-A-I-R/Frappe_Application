# Frappe Assessment App

This custom Frappe app was developed to demonstrate two key features:

1. **Bulk Conversion of Leads to Customers**
2. **Automated Event Reminders**

## üìå Features

### 1. Bulk Convert Leads to Customers

- Sends automatic reminders at:

  - 1 Day before the event
  - 1 Week before the event
- Triggers reminders via **email notifications**.

#### Technical Highlights

- Scheduled background jobs in `event_reminders.py`
